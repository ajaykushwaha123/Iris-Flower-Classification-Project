# Iris-Flower-Classification-Project
Certainly! Let's break down the key points into a set of concise, point-wise answers:

1. **IRIS Flower Classification:**
   - Refers to a dataset known as the Iris dataset.
   - Contains measurements for four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of 150 iris flowers.
   - The dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks.

2. **Predict Flowers based on Specific Features:**
   - The task involves predicting the type or species of iris flowers.
   - Prediction is based on specific features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

3. **Model Class Membership Probabilities:**
   - Rather than predicting a hard label, the goal is to predict the probabilities of the flower belonging to each class.
   - Classification algorithms are used to output probability distributions over the different flower species.

4. **Conditioned on Flower Features:**
   - The prediction of class membership probabilities is dependent on the specific features of the flower.
   - During training, the algorithm learns patterns and relationships between these features and the corresponding class labels.
